# Rodrigo Santana Gon√ßalves Basic dApp for RWA Invesing
A decentralized application to swap USDC for BLTM tokens representing ownership in Real-World Assets (RWA).

## Description
This dApp allows users to:  
‚úÖ Connect their MetaMask wallet  
‚úÖ View their USDC and BLTM balances  
‚úÖ Swap USDC for BLTM tokens  
‚úÖ Redeem BLTM tokens back for USDC  
‚úÖ Track deposit and withdrawal transactions in real time  

Users interact with a **LiquidityPool smart contract** that facilitates token swaps, enforces exchange rates, and maintains a balance of USDC and BLTM tokens.  

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), React, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi, Viem  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin  
- **Blockchain:** Hardhat Local Node (Ethereum-compatible)  
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask (Injected Connector) 

## Setup Instructions

### üìå Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)  
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension  
- Hardhat (installed via npm)  

### üöÄ Steps to Run the Project  

#### 1Ô∏è. Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bltm-token-swap.git
cd bltm-token-swap
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Start the Hardhat Local Node  
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

#### 4. Deploy the Smart Contracts  
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

#### 5. Start the Next.js Frontend  
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

#### 6Ô∏è. Connect MetaMask to the Localhost (Hardhat Network)
1. Open **Metamask** in your browser
1. Click **Networks ‚Üí Add Network ‚Üí Custom RPC**
1. Enter the following details:
   - **Network Name:** `Hardhat`
   - **New RPC URL:** `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
   - **Chain ID:** `31337`
1. Click **Save**
1. (Optional) Import **USDC and BLTM** manually using deployed addresses

## Approach and Challenges

### Approach
- Implemented and tested **ERC-20 token (BLTM)** using OpenZeppelin's contracts.
- Developed a **LiquidityPool contract** to facilitate token swaps and enforce exchange rates following the defined rules.
- Created a **React + Next.js frontend** to interact with the smart contracts and display user balances and transactions.
- Used **Wagmi & Viem** for efficient blockchain interaction and wallet connection.

### Challenges and how they were overcome
- **Issue**: Not enough allowance to swap tokens  
‚úÖ **Fix**: Called `approve()` function to allow the LiquidityPool contract to transfer USDC and burn BLTM on behalf of the user.
- **Issue:** Incorrect `burn()` function call in BLTM contract  
‚úÖ **Fix:** Fixed the function signature to `burnForm()` and tested the contract using Hardhat tests.
- **Issue:** ERC20InsufficientBalance error when redeeming BLTM  
‚úÖ Fix: Ensured users had enough BLTM before attempting to burn tokens.
- **Issue:**: Hardhat local node resets after restarting  
‚úÖ Fix: Used local snapshots or manually re-minted tokens for testing.
- **Issue:**: Internal JSON-RPC errors when interacting with the smart contracts after restarting local node and redeploying contracts  
‚úÖ Fix: Clean Metamask cache and restart the browser.

### üîÆ Suggested Improvements
- Persist transactions in local storage or a database (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL).
- Expand to multiple chains (Polygon, Arbitrum) using Wagmi‚Äôs or Wallet Connect multi-chain support.
- Improve UI with better styling and animations.
- Add "owner only" features like change BLTM exchange rate and withdraw all remain USDCs from the pool.
